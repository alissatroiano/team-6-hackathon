- **Daily Prompt** - A daily prompt will generate at the top of the page each day tot inspire thoughtful discussion and enforce positivity
- **Messaging** - Users can post messages and communicate on the platform
- **User Authentication** - Users can register and login to the platform
- **24-hour lifespan of messages** - All messages will be deleted from the feed at the end of each day and will no longer be accessible to users. This will be implemented so users can start fresh each new day.
