`const activities = [`
`"<h5><strong>Mindful Munch</strong></h5> <p>Remove distraction - put away phone, turn off tv, don’t eat at your desk, don't have a conversation, don't read - eat mindfully, smell the food, look at the food, chew mindfully and feel the textures and tastes for the entire meal/snack</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Hydrate</strong></h5>  <p>Get a fresh glass of water.  Take a few sips and drink mindfully, feel the cool water in your mouth and as you swallow feel how it trickles down your throat and nourishes your body.   Experience the taste, the texture.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Make no sound</strong></h5><p>Spend a few minutes attempting to make no sound.  For example when making a cup of tea, set your mug down gently when stirring ensure the spoon doesn't clink on the side of the mug.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Do a silly walk</strong> </h5> <p>At some point today, either in public or when you feel no one is around, do a silly walk.  You can walk backwards, skip, hop or walk in zig zags.  How does it make you feel?</p> ",`
`"<h5><strong>Take three deep breaths</strong></h5> <p>Several times throughout the day, take three deep breathes.  Notice how you feel before and after the breaths.  Inhale deeply through the nose and then exhale through the mouth with a sigh.</p> ",`
`"<h5><strong>Treat each interaction today as if it is your last</strong> </h5> <p>How would you want to speak to them, how would you want to listen.  Notice how this changes the way you interact with the people you come into contact with.</p> ",`
`"<h5><strong>Remind yourself you are AWESOME!</strong></h5> <p>Do this especially when looking into the mirror.  Look into your eyes and say “You are awesome.  Step out of your comfort zone and try something new.  Believe it when you say it.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Notice signals of impatience and anxiety</strong></h5> <p>Notice how it feels in your body and try to be aware of when it is coming and why it is happening. When you notice these signals, counter-act it with a deep breath.</p> ",`
`"<h5><strong>Imagine the journey of your meal</strong></h5> <p>Take a moment to look at the food and notice the journey the food has been on to arrive on your plate.  Imagine all of the hands that have been involved and all the weather conditions that have come together to create that meal.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Random Act of Kindness</strong></h5> <p>Perform a <strong>random act of kindness</strong> with no expectation of receiving something in return.  It does not need to be expensive.   Pay for someone's coffee, hold the door open for someone, pay a stranger a compliment, ask someone if there's anything you can help with.  For an extra challenge try to do this in secrecy.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Walk mindfully</strong></h5> <p>Take each step as though you are kissing the ground.  Walk intentionally but without stomping.  If you can, walk barefoot and take time to feel the sensations and textures of the ground beneath you.  Try walking on different surfaces, how does it feel?</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Eliminate using your phone whilst you are waiting</strong> </h5> <p>If you find yourself in a queue, waiting for the kettle to boil or another situation where you are waiting, resist the urge to take out your phone and start scrolling.</p> ",`

`"<h5><strong>Set your intentions</strong></h5> <p>Take a few moments to jot down 2-3 things that you would like to complete before the end of the day.

`"<h5><strong>Light a candle</strong></h5> <p>Light your favourite candle and watch the flame flicker and sway.  Gaze at the candle for five minutes and let your mind wander.  Observe your thoughts, then let them pass without judgment.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Gratitude Log</strong></h5> <p>Make a list of three things you are grateful for.   Focus on what is working for you at the moment and be specific.  For example instead of writing “I am grateful for friends” try ‘I am grateful for the phone-call I had with my friend last night.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Introspective exercise </strong> </h5> <p>Take a few minutes to sit silently and observe your current mental state and all of the emotions that exist for your right now.   Note which thoughts arise and think about why they maybe arising without remunerating on a problem.</p>",`

`"<h5><strong>Write something</strong> </h5><p>Find a notepad or a piece of paper and write down anything that comes to mind.  It doesn't have to be creative or beautiful,  it doesn't have to be profound or even make any sense.  Just go with it.  Try and write a few pages or at least three paragraphs.   Doing this exercise regularly could help you release and process what is happening mentally.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>The Sound Game</strong></h5> <p>Sit quietly and try to write down 10 things you can hear.  Can you hear sounds inside your body, in the room, outside of the room, outside of the building you are in.  Do you notice some sounds more than others.    This is a particularly good task to do when you are feeing frustrated with work or a difficult interaction.</p>",`
`"<h5><strong>Tidy your area</strong> </h5> <p>take a few minutes to clear your space of distractions, this could be empty coffee cups, things that need to be put away or even just wiping the surface of your work station clean.  If you’re working from home, you may want to think about lighting a scented candle, opening the window or using room spray to change the energy of the space by freshening it up.</p> ",`
`"<h5><strong>Narrow down your todo list </strong></h5> <p>STOP!  Take a moment to close any tabs, programs, apps or emails you are not immediately working on.
